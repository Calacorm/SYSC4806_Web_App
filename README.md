# SYSC4806_Web_App
## Overview
This web app will serve as a self-serve customer portal for an existing app called AppX. This app will be able to register new customer accounts and have existing customers login so they can start using AppX. A customer can also register for a free trial which will allow them to use the AppX service for 30 days and have a limit of 1,000 API calls per day. A paid user will be able to use the AppX service for a certain amount of time which is set by the Admin.

## Current State of the Project
The project has been initialized with all the components including CircleCI and Heroku being up and running. The app currently has the generic functionality of login and register. 

## Plan for the next sprint
The plan for the next sprint is:
- Make the login and registering process more secure
- Add different level of access depending on the type of customer: Admin, Paid customer and Trial customer
- Make the app more visually appealing by adding CSS files
