# SYSC4806_Web_App
## Overview
This web app will serve as a self-serve customer portal for an existing app called AppX. This app will be able to register new customer accounts and have existing customers login so they can start using AppX. A customer can also register for a free trial which will allow them to use the AppX service for 30 days and have a limit of 1,000 API calls per day. A paid user will be able to use the AppX service for a certain amount of time which is set by the Admin.
